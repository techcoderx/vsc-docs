VSC's technology stack is built to enable secure, decentralized cross-chain functionality and seamless dApp development. It combines WebAssembly-based smart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, threshold signature schemes, and decentralized vault infrastructure to support native asset interoperability with chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hive, and Solana.

Validators play a central role in maintaining the network, processing transactions, securing vaults, and reaching consensus. Vaults are decentralized smart contracts that hold and manage assets from external chains with high fault tolerance and slashing-backed security.

Together, this architecture enables VSC to deliver a trustless, feeless, and composable smart contract platform capable of moving and interacting with native assets across ecosystems.
