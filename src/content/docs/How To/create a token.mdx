This tutorial describes the process of creating a basic fungible token on VSC.

<Aside type="note" title="Prior Reading">
This guide assumes that you have read the smart contract development guide [here](/how-to/smart-contract-development).
</Aside>

## Setup

Clone the Go contract template:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vsc-eco/go-contract-template your-token
cd your-token
```

## Write Your Token Contract

<Aside type="caution">
The specification for defining VSC token contracts are not final.
</Aside>

An example token contract has been included in [`examples/token/main.go`](https://github.com/vsc-eco/go-contract-template/blob/main/examples/token/main.go) file. You may copy this file into `contract/main.go` to use as a starting point.

```sh
cp examples/token/main.go contract
```

The token contract features mint/burn with supply cap, transfer and change ownership functions. Update the following constants at the top of the file to your desired values:

```go title="main.go"
const MaxSupply = 1000000
const Precision = 3
const Symbol = "TOKEN"
const Creator = "hive:vaultec.vsc"
```

<Aside type="note">
The `Creator` address will be the initial owner of your token contract. You will need to have access to this account to initialize your token and mint new tokens.
</Aside>

## Deploy Token

Compile your token contract:

```sh
tinygo build -gc=custom -scheduler=none -panic=trap -no-debug -target=wasm-unknown -o build/main.wasm contract/main.go
wasm-tools strip -o build/main-striped.wasm build/main.wasm
```

Then deploy the contract:

```sh
# If not done already, init config and fill in deployer active key
vsc-contract-deploy -init

# Deploy token
vsc-contract-deploy -wasmPath build/main-striped.wasm -name "your token name"
```

## Initialize Token

Call the `init` function from your token contract owner address as specified in the `Creator` constant. The contract call payload does not matter here.

## Mint Tokens

Call the `mint` function where payload is the amount to mint. The tokens minted will be sent to your address.

## Burn Tokens

Call the `burn` function where payload is the amount to burn. The tokens will be burnt from the caller address.

## Transfer Tokens

Call the `transfer` function where payload is a comma-separated string of destination address and amount.

For example, to transfer 10 coins to `did:pkh:eip155:1:0xtoaddresshere`, the payload shall be `did:pkh:eip155:1:0xtoaddresshere,10`.
