*Securing the VSC Protocol through Hive Staking and Consensus Participation.*

Validators are responsible for **securing the VSC network**, maintaining consensus, and validating all state changes â€” including deposits, withdrawals, and in-protocol actions like swaps or mapped transfers. They run the VSC validator software and participate in the consensus mechanism by **staking HIVE tokens**, which aligns their incentives with the integrity of the system.

### Validator Responsibilities 

- **Confirm asset deposits** from connected chains and reflect them in the VSC ledger.
- **Validate in-protocol actions** (swaps, transfers, mint/burn logic) with precision.
- **Process withdrawals** and sign native asset transactions for outbound transfers.
- **Uphold consensus** over the VSC state, using Hive as the final source of truth.
- **Govern protocol changes** through participation in upgrades and configuration.

### Why Validators Matter

Validators are the backbone of the trustless design in VSC. Because VSC doesn't rely on bridges or centralized actors, **honest validation** is key to keeping assets safe and operations decentralized. Their staking of HIVE ensures skin in the game and allows the protocol to slash or remove malicious actors.
