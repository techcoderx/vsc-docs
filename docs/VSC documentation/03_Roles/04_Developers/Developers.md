# **Developers: Build Decentralized Applications (dApps) on VSC**

Developers on VSC gain a powerful advantage. Any application they build is instantly **interoperable with all supported blockchains**. VSC acts as a cross-chain hub which means your project isn’t siloed to one ecosystem. Instead, it's natively accessible to users from multiple chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Hive and others.

Thanks to **wallet interoperability**, any wallet address, regardless of what chain it belongs to can immediately invest in, interact with, or purchase assets from your respective dApp. A Bitcoin holder can fund a game, join a DeFi protocol, or purchase NFTs, all directly, and without needing to swap for a supported token beforehand.

VSC enables developers to build powerful decentralized applications using **WebAssembly (Wasm)-based smart contracts**, which are secure, fast, and compatible with multiple programming languages. These smart contracts operate directly on VSC’s decentralized infrastructure, offering full control and flexibility without any central points of failure.

A major breakthrough for developers on VSC is **Native Asset Mapping**. This allows smart contracts to interact  with native assets - such as BTC, ETH, Hive and SOL - **inside** the smart contract environment.

This capability means developers can build advanced dApps that utilize native assets seamlessly, whether it’s payments, games, DeFi tools, or even decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These applications can move and manage native assets in real time with the same ease or in many cases easier, than native tokens on a single chain.

What makes this even more powerful is VSC’s **zero-fee internal architecture**. Users only pay once to enter or exit VSC - that is, the on-chain transaction to deposit or withdraw an asset like BTC or ETH. But inside VSC, **all asset movements are feeless due to using the unique resource credit system on VSC**. This enables smoother user experiences and dramatically lowers operational costs.

In short, developers can:

- Use native BTC, ETH, SOL, and more directly in smart contracts
- Build DEXs, payment systems, and asset management tools with full native coin support
- Eliminate in-protocol fees, improving UX and scalability

VSC offers a radically different developer experience: **native asset programmability, zero-fee architecture, all in one system.**
