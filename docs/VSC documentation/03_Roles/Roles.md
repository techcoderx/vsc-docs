# **ROLES**

In the VSC ecosystem, there are several important roles:

1. **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: Contribute assets to liquidity pools and earn transaction fees.
2. **Senders & receivers (via Native Asset Mapping)**
3. **Validators**: Secure the network by staking Hive tokens and verifying transactions.
4. **Developers**: Build decentralized applications (dApps) using VSCâ€™s smart contracts.
5. **dApp Users**: Interact with decentralized applications.
6. **Swappers**: Execute cross-chain asset swaps.
7. **Arbitrageurs**: Capitalize on price differences across liquidity pools and chains to profit.
