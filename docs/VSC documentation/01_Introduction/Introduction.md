# **Introduction**

*Welcome to the official documentation for VSC (Virtual Smart Chain), the next evolution in cross-chain payment infrastructure.*

**VSC** is a neutral, decentralized protocol that acts as a crosschain hub for EVM, non-EVM (Solana, Bitcoin, Litecoin…) chains under one seamless, secure, and lightning-fast roof.

Built as a high-performance, feeless settlement layer, VSC leverages **WebAssembly smart contracts**, **zero-knowledge proofs**, **validator-managed vaults** and a **collateral-backed native asset model** to unify fragmented liquidity across ecosystems.

All swaps are routed through a single base asset, a stablecoin, **HBD (Hive Backed Dollars). Using HBD exposes LPs only to 1-sided volatility which** makes liquidity provision on VSC **more predictable, safer, and attractive** for both institutional and retail participants.

Unlike other cross-chain protocols limited to basic swap mechanics, VSC supports **full-featured smart contract execution**, allowing developers to build truly composable, cross-chain decentralized applications within the protocol itself.

**Core Protocol Features:**

- **Native Multi-Chain Asset Support** 

Assets from supported blockchains (including Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and others) are deposited directly into **on-chain vaults** secured by VSC validators. These validators are required to stake **Hive** as economic collateral, ensuring security and accountability.

- **Native Asset Mapping** 

VSC enables assets from different blockchains (e.g., BTC, SOL, Hive, ETH) to be securely locked on their native chains and mapped to VSC-connected addresses. This allows Ethereum wallet addresses to hold native Bitcoin (BTC), Solana wallet addresses to hold native Ethereum (ETH), and vice versa, all while leveraging VSC's decentralized validator network for seamless cross-chain interoperability.

- **Feeless In-Protocol Swaps** 

VSC eliminates gas fees for users by utilizing Hive’s **resource credit model**.

- **HBD as the Base Asset in All Pairs** 

Liquidity pools on VSC pair every asset against **HBD**, an algorithmic stablecoin with a decade-long track record of uptime and stability. This standardizes routing paths and simplifies liquidity provisioning across assets and chains while preventing volatility shocks and requiring exposure to a secondary volatile asset.

- **Smart Contracts via WebAssembly (WASM)** 

Developers can build powerful on-chain logic using WASM-based contracts, with native access to assets from multiple chains.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Architecture** 

ZKPs are used to validate external chain interactions and maintain verifiability across systems, without compromising speed or user privacy.

- **Universal Wallet Interoperability** 

Users can interact with the protocol using wallets from any supported blockchain, removing the need to manage multiple accounts or formats.

- **Human-Centric Identity Layer** 

Through native Hive integration, users benefit from readable usernames, account abstraction, social login, enabling Web2 simplicity without sacrificing decentralization.
