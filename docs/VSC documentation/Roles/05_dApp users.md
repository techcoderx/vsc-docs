# dApp Users: Interact with Decentralized Applications

dApp Users are individuals who interact directly with decentralized applications built on the VSC network. These applications range from DeFi tools and payment services to games, NFT platforms, remittance tools, and more, all powered by **WebAssembly-based smart contracts** on a secure, feeless, and decentralized infrastructure.

What sets VSC apart for users is the **native asset experience**. Thanks to **Native Asset Mapping**, users can interact with dApps using real, native assets like BTC, ETH.

VSC dApp users benefit in key ways:

- **Native asset ownership**
- **Feeless experience**: Once assets are inside VSC, users can move and interact with them across dApps **without paying any network fees**.
- **Interoperable UX**: A user with an ETH wallet can seamlessly interact with applications involving Bitcoin or Solana-based assets, without needing additional wallets or chains.
- **Secure and decentralized**: All interactions happen on-chain and are secured by the VSC validator network, eliminating reliance on centralized servers or custodians.

This creates a fundamentally smoother and more powerful user experience: less friction, no need for managing multiple wallets for every single blockchain.

VSC dApps behave like you're interacting with a single, universal chain even though you're working with many different native assets underneath.

In essence, dApp users on VSC gain access to a **next-generation blockchain experience**: decentralized apps that are chain-agnostic, feeless in operation, and capable of handling real, native crypto assets seamlessly.
