# Arbitrageurs: Capitalize on Price Differences Across Liquidity Pools and Chains to Profit

Arbitrageurs take advantage of price discrepancies between liquidity pools and across chains within the VSC ecosystem. By quickly executing trades between pools or chains, they profit from differences in asset prices. VSCâ€™s decentralized cross-chain infrastructure and native asset support allow arbitrageurs to identify and capitalize on price inefficiencies without relying on third-party services.

Key benefits include:

- **Cross-Chain Opportunities**: Profit from price differences across multiple chains connected to VSC.
- **Native Asset Trading**: Trade with actual native assets (e.g., BTC, ETH).
- **Decentralized & Secure**: Operate in a trustless, validator-secured environment ensuring trade security and transparency.

Arbitrageurs help maintain price equilibrium across the VSC ecosystem by acting on market inefficiencies, driving liquidity and stability.
